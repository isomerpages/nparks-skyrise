### What is skyrise greenery?

Skyrise greenery refers to rooftop and/or vertical greenery where greenery is extended skywards in the built environment through the greening of facades, balconies, mid-level and roof spaces.

By creating multi-tiers of greenery and optimising the use of urban spaces for greenery and recreation, urban dwellers will be immersed in greenery not only at ground level but also at elevated spaces, enhancing their quality of life through their work and living environment.
