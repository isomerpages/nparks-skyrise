Rooftop greenery refers to the greening of rooftop surfaces. When appropriately designed, rooftop greenery can significantly improve building performance, which includes:

*   Improved air quality
*   Better acoustic insulation
*   Enhanced durability of water-proof barriers
*   Reduced urban heat island effect
*   Improved rainwater retention
*   Increased energy efficiency

There are two main categories of rooftop greenery ranging from a simple green roof (extensive rooftop greenery) to an elaborate roof garden (intensive rooftop greenery). However, in recent years, many hybrid forms of rooftop greenery can be seen emerging throughout the island.
