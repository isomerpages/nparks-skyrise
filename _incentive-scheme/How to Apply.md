## **Application Process**

To begin an application for the Skyrise Greenery Incentive Scheme (SGIS), please submit your details on [**FormSG**](https://form.gov.sg/5cee3b050a5be80010bd5a73)**.**

There are two stages in the SGIS application process:

*   Application stage

*  Reimbursement stage


### **Stage 1: Application**

After submitting your details, our Skyrise Greenery Manager will contact you to guide you on the process, including the submission of relevant application forms and supporting documents. You are required to submit your application before any site work begins.

Your proposed skyrise greenery project will be assessed for SGIS based on the project’s merits and ability to contribute towards climate, ecological and social resilience goals.

If your application is approved, you will receive a letter of offer from NParks. This letter of offer will be valid for 12 months during which the project should be completed, with extension allowed upon request. **You may only begin installation works upon receiving the letter of offer**.

##### *Additional steps for MOE schools*

Schools under the Ministry of Education (MOE) are required to inform MOE (School Campus Division) of their proposed skyrise greenery installation. A copy of MOE SCD's written acknowledgement of the works should be submitted to NParks together with the application documents.

#### **Documents Required for SGIS Application for Rooftop/Vertical Greenery**

#### **Alteration**
NParks’ prior approval should be sought for any changes to the submitted plant species or rooftop/vertical greenery plan as deviation from the approved plan may affect SGIS approval and subsequent reimbursement.

### **Stage 2: Reimbursement**
Once the installation is completed, please contact your Skyrise Greenery Manager to begin the reimbursement process. NParks will arrange a site inspection to ensure that **80% greenery coverage** of the proposed plan has been achieved.
