To increase greenery provision in Singapore, the National Parks Board has introduced the Skyrise Greenery Incentive Scheme (SGIS) where we will fund up to 50% of installation costs of rooftop greenery and vertical greenery.

Since its introduction in 2009, SGIS has assisted in greening more than 110 existing buildings in Singapore by retrofitting them with extensive green roofs, edible gardens, recreational rooftop gardens, and lush verdant green walls.

SGIS 2.0 is the enhanced version of our incentive scheme which features a revised maximum cap for both rooftop greenery and vertical greenery. We hope to facilitate the development of a more lush and pervasive greenery in our built environment by encouraging more intensive forms of landscaping on built structures.

*Note: Application for incentive scheme does not require any administrative fees. For any queries pertaining to the scheme, please send your query to us directly via our website form here. *

**Objectives**

The incentive scheme aims to achieve the following objectives:
* Encourage the installation of skyrise greenery on existing buildings across Singapore.
* Create a distinctive image of the city in the tropical climate through extensive greenery adorning building facades and skyrise levels; and,
* Bring about environmental benefits such as mitigating the urban island heat effect and improving the air quality through the plantsâ€™ transpiration and filtration of dust particles.
* 
**Effective Date**

The incentive scheme is effective from 1 April 2015 and will expire on 31 March 2023 or when the incentive scheme funds are fully disbursed, whichever earlier. Participation in the scheme will be on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to availability of funds.
