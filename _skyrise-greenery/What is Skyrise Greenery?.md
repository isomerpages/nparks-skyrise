Skyrise Greenery is a term coined in Singapore and refers to both rooftop and
vertical greenery. It is an important strategy to increase greenery in urban environments under Singaporeâ€™s City in Nature vision, and also a key pillar of Singapore Green Plan 2030. Skyrise greenery extends greenery skywards in the built environment through the greening of facades, balconies, terraces, and roof spaces.

By creating multi-tiers of greenery and optimising the use of urban spaces for greenery and recreation, urban dwellers will be immersed in greenery not only at ground level but also at elevated spaces, enhancing their quality of life through their work and living environment.
