## **THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSION**

Rooftop greenery refers to the greening efforts and landscaping on the rooftop. When appropriately designed, rooftop greenery can significantly improve building performance, and the benefits includes:
* Improved air quality
* Better acoustic insulation
* Enhanced durability of water-proof barriers
* Reduced urban heat island effect
* Improved rainwater retention
* Increased energy efficiency

In general, there are three types of rooftop greenery:

* Green roofs (extensive)
* Hybrid gardens
* Roof gardens (intensive)

Increasingly, rooftop spaces are also being transformed into spaces for urban farming.

#### Green Roof (extensive rooftop greenery)
Green roofs are considered extensive in nature and are generally not designed for active recreational use. They are developed mainly for aesthetic and ecological benefits. Generally, these type of roofs are low in installation costs, lightweight (90 - 150 kg/m2) and require minimal maintenance.

#### Roof Garden (intensive rooftop greenery)
Roof Gardens, on the other hand, are considered intensive in nature and are designed to be accessible. Often used as recreation and social spaces, these roof gardens have higher capital costs, associated with added weight and have higher maintenance requirements.

#### Components of the Green Roof System
There are five basic components to a green roof system:

*   Plants layer
*   Substrates and media layer
*   Filter layer
*   Drainage and storage cells layer
*   Protection membrane and root barrier layer

Though there are different systems and technology used in the industry, all of them are based on the same component principles. These systems are designed differently in order to meet various site conditions and needs.

The green roof system of an intensive rooftop garden needs a more substantial depth of the substrate/ soil media layer to accommodate the healthy growth of a wider variety of plant groups, as compared to a simple extensive green roof.
