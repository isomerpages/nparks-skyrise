Rooftop greenery refers to the greening efforts and landscaping on rooftop surfaces. In general, there are three types of rooftop greenery:

* Green roofs (extensive)
* Hybrid gardens
* Roof gardens (intensive)

Increasingly, rooftop spaces are also being transformed into spaces for urban farming.

Green roofs are considered extensive in nature and are generally not designed for active recreational use. They are developed mainly for aesthetic and ecological benefits. Generally, these type of roofs are low in installation costs, lightweight (90 - 150 kg/m2) and require minimal maintenance.

Roof Gardens, on the other hand, are considered intensive in nature and aredesigned to be accessible. Often used as recreation and social spaces, theseroof gardens have higher capital costs, associated with added weight and have higher maintenance requirements.
