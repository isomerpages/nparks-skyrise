<p><strong>Singapore Urban Design Guidebook</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>This e-book, published by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) looks
at the ways greenery is integrated into the urban fabric at various scales
to enhance the liveability of the city, covering planning and urban design
efforts to help Singapore transition from being a “Garden City” to a “City
in Nature”.</p>
<p>It presents URA’s urban design strategies in shaping buildings and skyrise
greenery, sharing how greenery is created within development spaces where
people live, work and play.</p>
<p>Find out more about the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH)
policy, and how it influences developers to design and incorporate skyrise
greenery into new developments.</p>
