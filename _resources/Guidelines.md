Skyrise greenery is an up-and-coming sector of the landscape industry, with new materials, fresh ideas and techniques constantly emerging to cater to the increasing demand. Boundaries are explored and challenged, encouraging the surfacing of new supply chains and new job skills.

The objective of the Skyrise Greenery Guidelines is to set out the basic requirements in the construction of skyrise greenery â€“ intended to act as a common reference point for quality assurance.

Some of the topics in progress, pertaining to Rooftop Greenery standards & guidelines, are:

*   Design Loads
*   Design for Safety on Rooftop Greenery
*   Plants & Plant Selection
*   Vegetation Support Layer
*   Filter Layer
*   Drainage Layer
*   Protection against Root Penetration
*   Water Proofing Layer

Beyond the infancy of this initial phase of Skyrise Greenery, new areas of concern / issues that surface will subsequently be brought to attention and addressed in the near future. When necessary, new standards & guidelines will be developed to cater to the growing industry demand.
