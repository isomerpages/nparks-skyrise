4.	Is an irrigation system required?
</b></font><font color="green">
</font></label>
    <div>
      <p>Green roofs are intended to be non-irrigated. Usually, the drainage layer comes incorporated with an integrated water reservoir. However, green roofs with integrated irrigation are not uncommon.

If you are considering installing irrigation for your green roof, drip-irrigation is the preferred choice. Sub-surface drip irrigation optimizes the use of water by directly dampening the substrate.

6.	Will a green roof affect my waterproofing?
</b></font>
</label>
    <div>
      <p>Correct installation of a green roof will not have any adverse effect on the waterproofing. The additional layers of a green roof can protect the roofing membrane from UV rays, extreme temperature fluctuations and puncture. The reduced stress can double the serviceable life of the waterproofing.
