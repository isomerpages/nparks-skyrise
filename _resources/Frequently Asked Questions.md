4.	Is an irrigation system required?
</b></font><font color="green">
</font></label>
    <div>
      <p>An irrigation system is generally required for most green wall systems and intensive roof gardens to ensure the healthy growth of plants. </p><p>Extensive green roofs may be designed to be self-sustaining without irrigation through the use of integrated water reservoirs in the drainage layer and the selection of drought tolerant plants. However, green roofs with integrated irrigation are not uncommon. If you are considering installing irrigation for your skyrise greenery, sub-surface drip-irrigation system is the preferred choice as it optimizes the use of water by directly dampening the substrate.

</b></font>

6.	Will a green roof affect my waterproofing?
</b></font>
</label>
    <div>
      <p>Correct installation of a green roof will not have any adverse effect on the waterproofing. The additional layers of a green roof can protect the roofing membrane from UV rays, extreme temperature fluctuations and puncture. The reduced stress can double the serviceable life of the waterproofing.

7.	Is rooftop greenery expensive to maintain?
</b></font>
</label>
    <div>
      <p>Maintenance costs will vary depending on the nature, scale and design of the project. You can work with your contractor to design a solution to fit within your budget. To minimise cost, consider a sustainable green roof where plants are allowed to flourish together as nature intends. Such naturalistic landscape design requires less maintenance and is a great choice to achieve biodiversity, and an environmentally friendly rooftop greenery.
