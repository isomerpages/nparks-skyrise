4.	Is an irrigation system required?
</b></font><font color="green">
</font></label>
    <div>
      <p>Green roofs are intended to be non-irrigated. Usually, the drainage layer comes incorporated with an integrated water reservoir. However, green roofs with integrated irrigation are not uncommon.

If you are considering installing irrigation for your green roof, drip-irrigation is the preferred choice. Sub-surface drip irrigation optimizes the use of water by directly dampening the substrate.
